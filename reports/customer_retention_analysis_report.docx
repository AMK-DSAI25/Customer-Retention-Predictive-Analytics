Customer Retention Analysis Report

1. Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data and build a machine learning model to predict customer churn risk.

2. Dataset Overview
The dataset includes customer demographic attributes such as age, gender, marital status, and income level.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Key insights observed during EDA include:
- Age distribution trends
- Churn patterns across income levels
- Gender-based churn behavior

4. Feature Engineering
Since no churn label was available, a churn variable was engineered based on customer attributes to simulate churn behavior.

5. Model Building
A Logistic Regression model was trained to predict churn risk.

6. Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics to assess predictive performance.

7. Business Recommendations
- Identify high-risk customer segments
- Target retention campaigns toward vulnerable demographics
- Use churn predictions to support proactive decision-making
